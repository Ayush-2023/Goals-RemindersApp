                <p>
                    This API can be used by Developers of G&R App, where they can serve those in need to manage their
                    day-to-day tasks.
                    <br>
                    The API will be build on Tech Stack of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB hosted on Render website. It can
                    be directly accessed over internet.
                    <br>
                    Future Scope of software include paginated implementations of Fetch(READ) Functionalities, caching
